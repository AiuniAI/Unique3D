# Unique3D
Official implementation of Unique3D: High-Quality and Efficient 3D Mesh Generation from a Single Image

## [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20343) | [Project page](https://wukailu.github.io/Unique3D/) | [Huggingface Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Wuvin/Unique3D) | [Gradio Demo](https://u45213-bcf9-ef67553e.westx.seetacloud.com:8443/) | [Online Demo](https://www.aiuni.ai/)

* Demo inference speed: Gradio Demo > Huggingface Demo > Huggingface Demo2 > Online Demo

**If the Gradio Demo unfortunately hangs or is very crowded, you can use the Online Demo, which is free to try, and the registration invitation code is `aiuni24`. However, the Online Demo is slightly different from the Gradio Demo, in that the inference speed is slower, and the generation results is less stable, but the quality of the material is better.**

## Preparation for inference

### Linux System Setup.
```angular2html
conda create -n unique3d
conda activate unique3d
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Interactive inference: run your local gradio demo.

1. Download the weights from [huggingface spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Wuvin/Unique3D/tree/main/ckpt) or [Tsinghua Cloud Drive](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/d/319762ec478d46c8bdf7/), and extract it to `ckpt/*`.
```

        ├── img2mvimg/
        ├── realesrgan-x4.onnx
        └── v1-inference.yaml
```

2. Run the interactive inference locally.
```bash
python app/gradio_local.py --port 7860
```

## Tips to get better results

1. Unique3D is sensitive to the facing direction of input images. Due to the distribution of the training data, orthographic front-facing images with a rest pose always lead to good reconstructions.
2. Images with occlusions will cause worse reconstructions, since four views cannot cover the complete object. Images with fewer occlusions lead to better results.
3. Pass an image with as high a resolution as possible to the input when resolution is a factor.

## Collaborations
Our mission is to create a 4D generative model with 3D concepts. This is just our first step, and the road ahead is still long, but we are confident. We warmly invite you to join the discussion and explore potential collaborations in any capacity. <span style="color:red">**If you're interested in connecting or partnering with us, please don't hesitate to reach out via email (wkl22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn)**</span>.
